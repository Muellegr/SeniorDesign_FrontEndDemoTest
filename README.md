# SeniorDesign_FrontEndDemoTest
OSU Senior Design to demonstrate a working, very low quality front end for an oscilloscope.

Due to being used in a presentation-like assignment I put a lot of focus on cleary seperating system blocks at the cost of longer signal traces.  
4 layers were used for ease of life and some signal quality. The back plane is nearly unused excluding some very minor power routing below the differential op amp.
